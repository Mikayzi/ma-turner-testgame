In this assignment we'll be making a simple grid-based board game, think tic-tac-toe, connect4, or checkers. Do not simply copy one of these games, instead you'll be desinging your own. Keep things very simple tho!
The basic game will work like this: render the board based on the state, get input, update the state, have the comptuer make a move, update the state, then repeat.
You should use an array of ints to represent the spots on your board. For an example in a tic-tac-toe game you would have an array of 9 integers going top left to bottom right. If an element in the array is 0 that means it's empty, if it's a 1 that could be X, if it's 2 that could be an O.
Have a clear win and lose condition
When the game is over the player should be able to play again.
Allow the player to press the H key to bring up the rules of the game.
You should handle bad input by asking for input again.
The AI should do more than make random moves (but it doesn't have to be that smart)
You must create a class to store the game memory and methods. All Main() should do is allocate an instance of that class and call the Update method.
Use the Console.Clear() method to wipe the screen

Idea 1: A game like Battleship (9x9 grid) where you dodge randomly ai placed blocks (new block placed every clear) as you get from bottom side of the grid to the top. Maybe 12x12 grid.

Idea 2: A game where ai randomly hides a symbol (X,$,%) in a 9x9 grid and player has to find it. Counts the turns. Treasure hunt? Hidden symbol hunt.
